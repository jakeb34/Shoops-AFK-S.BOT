S.Bot Stands for: Shoop's Bot
This build is a very simple AFK bot that makes use of Steam bot functions to provide the user / Client the ability to
automatically send messages to people when they initiate a chat type. Chat types include things like: Messages,
Or typing (When a friend starts typing to you) and invites.

Use:

Start the (AFK S.BOT.exe) and enter your steam username and password (username is NOT nickname, it is the same account
name you use to login normally)

[ATTENTION]: NO PASSWORDS ARE STORED / ACCESSABLE, THEY ARE SIMPLY USED TO LOG INTO
YOUR STEAM ACCOUNT / PROVIDE ACCESS TO YOUR CLIENT.

SteamGuard: The first time your use this program you will be prompted for a SteamGuard activation code, this will
be sent to your email address you use with your steam account.

How It Works:

Action : Result

A friend begins typing to you : The bot will send them a message through steam chat saying you're AFK / BUSY

A friend sends you a message anyway : Repeats the Notice

A friend sends you a game invite : Also repeats the Notice

[Everything can be seen in the console window, it will automatically tell you if they started typing,
or any messages they sent / game invites.]


TO DO:

There isn't currently a pause button but it may be something to add in the future.

[IDEA] - The ability to write custom messages that will be sent to friends when they message you.
